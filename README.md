#### There are two main types of developers in this technology:</h4>
- Core developers
- App developers

##### Core developers :
 In core development, the developer writes the code for a blockchain client. Low-level programming languages are used in writing blockchain clients.
##### App developers :  
 In blockchain app development, we build apps on top of a blockchain client instead of creating a whole blockchain from scratch.
